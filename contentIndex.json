    "content": "I hated frontend development.\n\nI mainly make backends for websites. My last project which I also do the frontend is like 5 years ago. The knowledge I had on frontend is long outdated (jQuery, React 0.12-ish, Angular 1.) As a Ruby developer which rely heavily on testing, I also thought that frontend code is less useful to add tests since you can just refresh the page to see the changed code. Furthermore, my CSS skill is non-existent (still struggle just to center HTML elements.) So I used this [#100DaysOfCode](https://www.100daysofcode.com/) challenge to re-learn my frontend coding skill from scratch.\n\n#100DaysOfCode is the challenge where you code (or learn to code) every day for 100 days. I used my free time after work at least 30 minutes to create websites, then learn new techniques \u0026 frameworks along the way.\n\nIn the course of 100 days, I've learned and tried many frameworks such as React.js (version 16), Vue.js 3, Svelte, Alpine.js, Next.js, Nuxt.js, Gatsby.js, and many more. I also created some reusable templates like [Next.js boilerplate](https://github.com/narze/thank-u-nextjs) which included many modern libraries I like.\n\nAfter I've rebuilt [toSkoy](https://github.com/narze/toSkoy) project which was nearly 5 years old in the 100th day. I gave a talk about this challenge \u0026 how to succeed it at [Bkk.js #14 meetup](https://www.eventpop.me/e/9622) ([Slides](https://bit.ly/bkkjs14bf100))\n\nI'm so proud of myself for completing this challenge. It really changed my life to be a better web developer.\n\nSee [my #100DaysOfCode website](https://100.narze.vercel.app/) (built with Gatsby.js)\n\nNext I'll take on [100 Days of Writing](100%20Days%20of%20Writing.md)",

Most of them are productivity related, some are tech/coding. I want to write fiction too, but I don't think I can in my current state. Some will be posted on [my Medium](https://medium.com/@narze) as I see fit. I will try to make around 30-50 articles. Let's see if I can make it until the end!",

This function returns a Promise that will resolve with the results of the mutation. That means, when working with mutations, you can simply chain the resulting Promises:\n\n```\nconst [doA] = useMutation(MUTATION_A)\nconst [doB] = useMutation(MUTATION_B)\n\n// elsewhere\nconst { data: { someValue } } = await doA()\nconst { data: { someResult } } = await doB({ variables: { someValue }\n```",

    "content": "After 7 years of switching to Colemak keyboard layout, I decided to move on to a new layout.\nI have seen [Mod-DH](https://colemakmods.github.io/mod-dh) for quite a while. It is an improvement on Colemak which will be easy for me.\n\nFor reason why I want to switch although I already achieved 100 words per minute on standard Colemak, is I just want to challenge myself and see how long I will take to rewire my muscle memory and get the typing speed back on track with the new layout.\n\n## Little problems with standard Colemak\n\nI can confirm that Colemak is already awesome. When compared with Qwerty, the keys oftenly used stay within home row and important shortcut keys are still in place (Z,X,C,V,A).\nHowever, Mod-DH improves it by moving D \u0026 H keys to bottom row but in easier position than on the home row but in the center which needs more lateral movement of the fingers.\n\nThe most common word which use letter T like `the` will use less effort in Colemak-DH than standard Colemak.\n\nOn 2017 Mod-DH made a minor revision which swaps the K and M but I prefer the first version which later called Colemak-DHm which still has M on the home row and K will be the same place as standard Colemak.\n\n## Switching\n\nThe total keys moved from standard Colemak to Colemak Mod-DHm is 6 Keys (B,D,G,H,M,V). I've highlighted them in my [Codepen](https://codepen.io/narze/pen/OJNLNKg), printed \u0026 attached it to my monitor to practice.\n\nOn first day I got around 40wpm on [10ff](http://10fastfingers.com/), and I use [Colemak Academy](https://www.colemak.academy) to practice mainly on D \u0026 H.\nI also noticed that with Mod-DHm, there are more words consists of home row letters plus D+H. I also use this mod at work \u0026 try not to type it wrong.\nI still use standard Colemak layout but swap the modded keys using [Karabiner Elements](https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org).\nThe hardest key on my switching journey is `V`, since I use `⌘ + V` all the time. I have to remap `⌘ + V` back from `B` to original position.\n\nAfter first week, I achieved 80wpm on average (I create [a new account on 10ff](https://10fastfingers.com/user/2163743/) to track my progress.)\nHowever, my speed on standard Colemak dipped from 100-ish to 50wpm, so I can't turn back anymore.",

    "content": "Every once in a while, I slipped into the world full of distractions, named the Internet. Like everyone does, I take hours viewing Youtube videos, scroll through Facebook posts, reading Tweets, and so on. All of them are neatly optimized that you'll keep checking them out, again and again.\n\nI stumbled upon this idea by [Andrew Kirby's Dopamine Detox][1] (Yeah, on his Youtube). The rule sounds easy but really hard to do. That is, don't do anything that gives you Dopamine. Which in the extreme level, includes eating as well. I tried it once and it works like a charm. But I have to admit that it is difficult since I still have to eat, feed dogs, write blogs. So I make a subset of Dopamine Detox. It's called Digital Detox.\n\nThe rule is more simple, of course. Just don't touch or use anything which distracts you digitally. I tried to do it twice a month, in the weekends. \n\n## My detoxification day\nBefore the day, I would prepare myself to reduce external factors and temptation to use my smartphone or computer.\n\n- Prepare a book to read, e-book reader is OK but make sure you have the book file and disable the network afterward.\n- Disable or mute all app notifications. I made an exception for the alarm clock app though.\n- Tell your friends or family that you'll be unavailable for a day.\n\nThen on the day after I put of the alarm. I leave my phone there and continue the day without it. Read the book you want to, write articles (I have a disconnected Macbook Air for this), meditate, play with my dogs, do chores.\n\n## Reflection\nThe Digital Detox helps me getting back on track. Sometimes I spent many hours a day watching Youtube and getting less sleep, and it affected the other day. Furthermore, it helps me focus more on doing things. I can read more than my other days as I tend to stop after a few pages. Lastly, I can feel the Dopamine rush when I can finally check the unread messages in the end of the day.\n\n[1]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vcGF3HqZXg",

The code is simple, just scanning all the words from the source, count, then sort it like [this](https://gist.github.com/narze/9a3b71757bd3915387397b2bbaa8e0c8). The data is not quite useful, but it gives the idea which keys should be in the home row.\n\n## Typing Effort Model\n\nNext, I've planned to create the typing effort model similar to [Carpalx][3]. But the finger travel distance will be altered a bit to suit my use on [40% Keyboard][4]. When I got the model working I'll train with the text from all the sources, including my chat logs.\n\n## Triads\n\nI get some Thai corpus data (eg. [Wisesight][5], [Wongnai][6]) then generate the triads to see which 3-character substrings are being used the most ([Code][7]). The triads will be [one of the parameters][8] to calculate the typing effort.\n\nHere are the sample triads I got from the corpus.\n\n### Wongnai : Top 30\n\n```\n ้าน : 134642\n ร้า : 119805\n ที่ : 118052\n ไม่ : 102900\n ่อย : 82040\n ได้ : 73344\n นี้ : 72915\n มาก : 69226\n เป็ : 66661\n แต่ : 66436\n ป็น : 62878\n เลย : 62262\n ว่า : 59965\n ค่ะ : 57345\n ข้า : 53751\n ั่ง : 51812\n รับ : 51245\n ร่อ : 50937\n อร่ : 50575\n นนี : 48245\n หาร : 44594\n ครั : 44076\n าหา : 43952\n และ : 43314\n อาห : 43283\n ื่อ : 41649\n ให้ : 41496\n น้ำ : 40458\n ทาน : 40247\n ่าง : 38617\n```\n\n### Wisesight : Top 30\n```\n ที่ : 10920\n ไม่ : 10329\n ได้ : 7626\n 555 : 6047\n รับ : 5944\n ว่า : 5886\n นี้ : 5704\n การ : 5318\n ื่อ : 5292\n ให้ : 4747\n ล้ว : 4504\n เป็ : 4498\n ครั : 4400\n แล้ : 4359\n ป็น : 4331\n เลย : 4298\n ้อง : 4186\n กิน : 3957\n แต่ : 3957\n กัน : 3939\n ของ : 3727\n และ : 3341\n มาก : 3283\n วัน : 3231\n ค่ะ : 3181\n กับ : 3085\n ประ : 3003\n ่าง : 2989\n ั้ง : 2978\n ้าง : 2968\n```\n\nSome of the words are on the both list although the context are not the same (Restaurant reviews VS Social media messages.)\n\nThe rest can be read on my [Medium](https://medium.com/@narze)\n\n[1]: /toward-a-more-useful-thai-keyboard-layout\n[2]: https://www.rust-lang.org\n[3]: http://mkweb.bcgsc.ca/carpalx/?typing_effort\n[4]: /40-percent-keyboard\n[5]: https://github.com/PyThaiNLP/wisesight-sentiment\n[6]: https://github.com/wongnai/wongnai-corpus\n[7]: https://github.com/narze/Manoonchai/tree/main/analyzer\n[8]: http://mkweb.bcgsc.ca/carpalx/?typing_effort#triads",

I keep it short but try to not skip a day. Imagine that exercising or reading 2 hours stright at once is harder than 15-30 minutes a day, but every day. Not only that you're likely to want to skip it, but you would also be so exhausted in the next day if you do it so hard.\n\nAnother technique I'd like to suggest is to leave the work undone so that you can continue to do it tomorrow. It works well on some cases, like in writing code, I can leave the source code unpushed or commented it with `Work in progress`.\n\nAirplanes cannot fly before up to a certain speed.\n\nRome was not built in a day.\n\n[Building habits](Atomic%20Habits.md) takes time, but keep making small changes to gain the momentum then that'll make you unstoppable.",

There are many Pomodoro apps but I like this once since it will block my screen, forcing me to take breaks.\n\nMy ratio is 30-minute work per 6-minute break (Standard is 25:5). I tweak so I can fit 4 sessions before and after [Power Nap](https://monosor.com/how-i-sleep)\n\nWhen I take breaks I'll do things to keep my mind out of work eg.\n\n-   Walk around\n-   Re-fill water bottles\n-   Quick chats with co-workers\n-   Toilet\n-   Practice typing on [Monkeytype](https://monkeytype.com/) (You can set Time Out to load any website on breaks.)\n-   Check emails on mobile phone\n-   Or just close my eyes until the break is finished\n\nThe Pomodoro technique really helps me on focusing, and keeping my energy throughout the day.",

  "/asdf-The-Ultimate-Version-Manager": {
    "title": "asdf - The Ultimate Version Manager",
    "content": "Due to the differences of the dependencies of your projects (and others on GitHub.) Now it's pretty normal to have multiple versions of programming languages like Python, Node.js, or even PHP, installed on your system. There're some tools like `pyenv`, `rbenv`, `nvm`, and many more, but most of them can work with only one language per tool, so you have to remember all of their commands if you work on multiple languages.\n\nEnter [`asdf`][https://asdf-vm.com], the universal version manager which works with most languages, and even cover some tools like [Vim][asdf-vim]!\n\nSince `asdf` is just a shell script with extensible plugin system. Installation is strightforward, [follow the instructions][install] to install it to the system. eg. If you use macOS:\n\n```shell\nbrew install coreutils curl git # Dependencies\nbrew install asdf\n```\n\nDon't forget to add `asdf` to your shell.\n\n```shell\n# zsh\necho -e \"\\n. $(brew --prefix asdf)/asdf.sh\" \u003e\u003e ~/.zshrc\n\n# bash\necho -e \"\\n. $(brew --prefix asdf)/asdf.sh\" \u003e\u003e ~/.bash_profile\n\n# fish\necho -e \"\\nsource \"(brew --prefix asdf)\"/asdf.fish\" \u003e\u003e ~/.config/fish/config.fish\n```\n\nRestart the shell. Now you're ready to add plugins! Firstly, list all the plugins.\n\n```shell\nasdf plugin list all\n\n# You'll see something like this\n...\nripgrep                       https://gitlab.com/wt0f/asdf-ripgrep.git\nrke                           https://github.com/particledecay/asdf-rke.git\nrlwrap                        https://github.com/asdf-community/asdf-rlwrap.git\nruby                         *https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf-ruby.git\nrust                         *https://github.com/code-lever/asdf-rust.git\nsaml2aws                      https://github.com/elementalvoid/asdf-saml2aws.git\nsbcl                          https://github.com/smashedtoatoms/asdf-sbcl.git\nsbt                           https://github.com/bram2000/asdf-sbt.git\nscala                         https://github.com/mtatheonly/asdf-scala.git\nscenery                       https://github.com/skyzyx/asdf-scenery.git\n...\n```\n\nI want to use [Rust][rust-for-rubyist]! So add Rust plugin.\n\n```shell\nasdf plugin add rust\n```\n\nThen, list all Rust versions.\n\n```shell\nasdf list all rust # or asdf latest rust to get only latest version\n\n# Output\n...\n1.43.1\n1.44.0\n1.44.1\n1.45.0\n1.45.1\n1.45.2\n1.46.0\n1.47.0\n```\n\nChoose the version and install it.\n\n```shell\nasdf install rust 1.47.0\n```\n\nSet the version and you're done!\n\n```shell\n# Local (will create .tool-versions in current directory)\nasdf local rust 1.47.0\n\n# Global (will create ~/.tool-versions)\nasdf global rust 1.47.0\n\n# Shell (Set the version to current shell session)\nasdf shell rust 1.47.0\n```\n\nSometimes after installing new version or other command line executables which uses languages in asdf, you must run `reshim` once to recreate shims and make the executables working.\n\n```shell\nasdf reshim [language]\n```\n\nNote: Some languages (like [Node.js][asdf-nodejs]) has some requirements before install. So you should look on the plugin's homepage before installing any plugins for the first time.\n\n[asdf]: https://asdf-vm.com\n[asdf-vim]: https://github.com/tsuyoshicho/asdf-vim\n[install]: https://asdf-vm.com/#/core-manage-asdf\n[rust-for-rubyist]: /rust-for-rubyist\n[asdf-nodejs]: https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf-nodejs#install",
